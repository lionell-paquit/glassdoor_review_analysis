Using R packages like rvest and purrr to scrape company reviews from Glassdoor.

Instead of using R to clean the data and create visualization, I save the data into CSV and loaded it to PowerBI.

It is very easy to extract, transform and load data to PowerBI. Visualization is also very easy by using drag-n-drop. PowerBI offers less to no coding in data analysis and visualization.

There are more analysis and visualization you can do with the data you have. 
It could also help answer several problems like understanding company's turnover rate. And as a job seeker, this could help give an overview on what it is like working in that company without scrolling every reviews. 

If you want to have a play around on the dashboard I created, you need to have a PowerBI account.
You can create and register an account for free. [PowerBI Sign Up](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/)
