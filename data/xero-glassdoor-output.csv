Terrific access to senior management who share all aspects of company strategy with staff. Office fit-outs are top notch and IT equipment is up to date.","Growing too fast. Poor HR contact with non-NZ offices. Acquired offices are not managed well with too much autonomy and not enough imposition of (excellent) Xero culture. Compensation is stingy."

They spend money on STUPID stuff when every red cent should be on marketing. They hire way too many leaders and not enough workers.

"31","Oct 19, 2014","Positioning for success in the US market","4.0","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in Denver, CO","Positive culture and a group of managers that are open, honest and have your best interests at heart. Many opportunities for advancement or transfer if you are willing to hustle for it. Great management program recently implemented.","Typical cons of any young company. Still building out policies and procedures without become overly corporate. Health benefits in the US could be a bit more competitive."
"32","Oct 19, 2014","Best employer I've ever had","5.0","Current Employee - Development Team Lead in Wellington, Wellington","Xero provides great opportunities to learn with exciting and interesting work.  They pay well, and know how to have fun.  They are open and honest and don't hide things from anyone.  They have strong company values that have real meaning and influence everything we do.

"33","Oct 19, 2014","Amazing","5.0","Current Employee - Graduate Developer in Wellington, Wellington","Fantastic Employer, Awesome Team. Working with a great bunch of people, who are all very supportive while I am in the early stages of my career. Great office space with a great culture.","Pay in Wellington. Actually the pay is fine, Wellington is just incredibly expensive. 50,000 a year means living with the parents, or having less expendable income than I did as a student. And Xero pays monthly, which is horrible."

Car parks are a bit of an issue but hey-ho you can't win everything."
"37","Oct 19, 2014","Great tech company with start-up culture but maturity","5.0","Current Employee - Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA","Well run development process. Constantly identifying needs and actively filling the holes. Don't ask people to wear too many hats, which can result in poorly filled roles.

Great coworkers, easy to make friends.

Great culture and good work life balance, flexible schedule.

Beautiful office. Awesome espresso machine.

Good compensation.

Expanding team, so lots of opportunity for advancement.","No name recognition in the US (hopefully this is changing). Not sexy to tell friends ""I build accounting software"". 

Benefits are good, but could always be better. ie Higher 401k contributions, public-transit passes, provide basic lunch supplies.

"39","Oct 19, 2014","Amazing team, high pressure","4.0","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in Wellington, Wellington","Most uniformly high-quality team I've ever worked with. Can't think of any dead weight. Great chairs, uniform hardware, free soft drinks, fantastic friday night drinks. Brilliant culture. Inspiring leaders and a uniform vision. Flexible working hours and minimum bureaucracy.","High pressure, very hard to leave work at work. Public and Global means there's always someone awake and emailing (although you aren't expected to reply outside hours, many do). So much going on it can be hard not to feel swamped. Processes always changing as we scale, 'no rules' is good but can be bewildering. Red tape creeping in as people start to cover their butts."
"40","Oct 19, 2014","Great company to work for, but experiencing growing pains","4.0","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in Wellington, Wellington","Not like any place I've worked before - for the better! Everyone is approachable, from the CEO down. If you have ideas everyone is keen to hear them. Relaxed dress code. Great offices. Great technology. Great product. CEO is inspiring.","Some areas suffer from lack of direction. There's been a lot of hiring middle management-types and a lot of these hires leave a lot to be desired - lots of talk, very little walk. Little opportunity for professional development unless you're in the Product teams. Company values are a little contrived and the way they're constantly drilled in is quite patronizing. Challenges the business is facing need to be more transparent..."
"41","Oct 19, 2014","As good as it gets!","5.0","Current Employee - Software Developer in Wellington, Wellington","Company culture - a sense of everyone pulling together and the stated goal to try keep the cohesiveness of a small company despite rapid growth.  The CEO  is a top class leader in his ability both to inspire and to deliver.  The company makes strong and very visible efforts to provide a positive working environment and to be ""last job you'll ever have"", and focuses benefits where they matter such as a generous  professional...","Rapid migration from a small regional company to a large multinational and significant market challenges means constant change, no complacency and no absolute certainty about what happens next. Its not clear whether culture can stay as it is or whether large corporate syndrome will start to take effect. Its not a place to hide but to engage your own entrepreneurial aptitudes!"

"45","Oct 19, 2014","Lots to learn about people","3.0","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee ","Lots of nice, friendly people to work with.  
Nice offices.","Very little career development- they scrapped the bonus so now there is no incentive for Managers to measure performance or have any interest in developing their staff.   This includes no professional development and no study budget for general staff.  Only Managers seem to get trained.
Perks/Salary - for a company with this many employees there are no perks, no decent health care benefits, no childcare, no car parking,..."
"46","Oct 19, 2014","Optimistic about giving it that 5th star soon.","4.0","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA","-Truly amazing product that WILL change the game once execution complete. Thankful and excited to be a part of it.
-Tons of smart people that are fun to work with.

"48","Oct 19, 2014","Loving it!","5.0","Current Employee - Architect in Wellington, Wellington","Great culture, very friendly company, growing rapidly and therefore there are lots of opportunities to contribute to the company and develop as an individual","Not a lot.

"49","Oct 20, 2014","Great and growing company","5.0","Current Employee - Developer Relations Manager in San Francisco, CA","Great overall company culture.  Ownership in projects and getting things done.  Putting user experience front and center in decisions.

The company trusts me to choose the right things to do. I'm building a team to tackle some pretty challenging technical work and I'm blown away by how many other Xeros want to be involved in this.","Fast growth means that (for example) processes aren't in place where they need to be and we're still finding our feet in some areas. There are technical challenges associated with rapid growth too. It's hard to hire enough good people to keep pace with our growth targets."
